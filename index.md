Welcome to *luigi's pages on web*, my name is Luigi Giannelli and I am a PhD student in theoretical physics at  *Universität des Saarlandes*.

I am interested in every aspect of science, especially *physics*. At the moment I am studying for a doctorate in theoretical physics and in particular I treat *quantum optics*, *atomic physics*, *many particle physics* and *optomechanics*.

My [Erdös Number](https://www.oakland.edu/enp/) is 3:
: 1. **Paul Erdös** authored with **Peter Salamon** *"The Solution to a Problem of Grünbaum"*, Canadian Mathematical Bulletin 31, 129 (1988),
  2. **Christiane P. Koch** authored with  **Peter Salamon** *"Controllability on relaxation-free subspaces: On the relationship between adiabatic population transfer and optimal control"*, Physical Review A 85, 033417 (2012),
  3. **Luigi Giannelli** authored with **Christiane P. Koch** *"Optimal storage of a single photon by a single intra-cavity atom"*, New Journal of Physics 20, 105009 (2018).
