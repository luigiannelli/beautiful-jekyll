Welcome to *luigi's pages on web*, my name is Luigi Giannelli and I am a PhD
student in theoretical physics at  *Universit√§t des Saarlandes*.

I am interested in every aspect of science, especially *physics*. At the
moment I am studying for a doctorate in theoretical physics and in particular
I treat *quantum optics*, *atomic physics* and *optomechanics*.
